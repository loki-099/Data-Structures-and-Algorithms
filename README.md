# **Data Structures and Algorithms Challenge Compilation**
*This is a git repository of my codes for the challenges in my Data Structures and Algorithms subject.*
> mostly of python codes
## **LAB01**
This challenge provided us with ten function equations that we had to graph using the Python library `matplotlib`. The x values of the graph had to be taken from a text file, and we had to use that value to finish the equation, which gave us the y values of the graph. You can view the screenshots of the results for each equation in the `Snapshots` folder.
